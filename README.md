This is Just a Hybrid Testing Framework to get the basic understanding and Integration with Jenkins CI/CD tool. I have created 2 files here testng.xml and smokeSuite.xml, the reason behind it is when the Build is deployed first time we need to perform Smoke testing. So we need a different POM.xml (dependency file) in which we define this smokeSuite.xml file in number 76 so it will run that test file and method that are defined inside that smokeSuite.xml file. Also we need to make minor changes in the run cammand . We will write -f smokeSuite.xml clean install.
